<h1>What is Tower Brick Lightning?</h1>
<p>
	Tower Brick Lightning is a massively multiplayer game about building a tower up to the heavens. By stacking and combining bricks you can build the tower but the higher you get, the more challenges arise. Work together with your fellow builders and maybe you'll be able to reach the tower. And you've been cursed, so your only forms of communication are a limited set of glyphs.

<p>
	Tower Brick Lightning is currently in open alpha, which means you can come and play but I may be changing things, adding new features, removing new features, deleting the entire tower, etc all the time. If you any feedback or encounter an error, don't hesitate to <a href = '/report'>report it.</a>
