<h1 class = "center">What are Levels?</h1>
<p>
	The tower can be divided into distinct levels, each one on top of the other.
  <span class = "overlap" data-text = "You approach">Go ever higher</span>. Different levels
  have different rules: it might take more or less time for bricks to be placed, require more
  strength, or <span class = "overlap" data-text = "even worse things">things yet unknown</span>.
</p>

<p>
	Builders can only put bricks one level above the highest level they've successfully built on so far.
  If you've successfully put bricks on level 2, you can put bricks on level 3 but no higher. Levels
  above that can't be seen or built on.
